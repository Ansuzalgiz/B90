# B90 Project

The goal of the B90 project is to make a FN P90 inspired electric flywheel BOOMco. blaster. The P90 magazine mechanism is used to fit a large ammo capacity in a compact form factor.

# Printing Parameters
Prototypes were printed using these parameters:
- PLA
- .2mm layer height
- .4mm nozzle

Supports should only be required for these parts:
- Foregrip
- Flywheel cage

# Issues

## BOOMco. darts get clogged in the magazine as it fills up. 
As BOOMco. darts get loaded into the magazine, the darts start deforming under pressure. The darts then press against the side walls of the magazine, drastically increasing the force needed to move them until they are completely stuck. The same behavior was observed with worker darts with a similarly designed magazine. 

## Pusher mechanism is untested
The pusher mechanism has been modified from its original design and has not been tested for correct functionality. 

# Contributing
The project was designed using Fusion 360, under their hobbyist license. Upon updating the Fusion 360 project, export and override the changed part STLs.
